RadarPhone

- Single-player radar game. The game consists of finding the place that appears on the radar (location position) (we can choose the location we want, be it a restaurant, supermarket, etc.). The player must move to geographically find the place, which will be shown on the screen with a radar.
- Once the player reaches the place, he wins the game (we will check this with the distance between the location of the mobile and the place to find).
- Possibility of customizing the colors of the user interface, nicknames, light and dark mode, as well as the profile picture.
- We will use the camera to take the profile picture.
- Get inspired by standard or more advanced radar images from the Internet.
- Firebase database.
- Time restriction of y minutes to win the game, and at least z minutes must pass to win the game.
- balsamiq for models.
