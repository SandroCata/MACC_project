RadarPhone

- Single-player radar game. The game consists of finding the place that appears on the radar (location position) (we can choose the location we want, be it a restaurant, supermarket, etc.). The player must move to geographically find the place, which will be shown on the screen with a radar.
- Once the player reaches the place, he wins the game (we will check this with the distance between the location of the mobile and the place to find).
- Possibility of customizing the colors of the user interface, nicknames, light and dark mode, as well as the profile picture.
- We will use the camera to take the profile picture.
- Get inspired by standard or more advanced radar images from the Internet.
- SQL database.
- Time restriction of y minutes to win the game, and at least z minutes must pass to win the game.
- To make the connection, the position of the place will be sent to the player so that he can locate it with the radar. As well as the player will send his position to know if he is approaching the place and complete the game.
